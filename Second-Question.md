# Dynamic Funnel Application - Empower Funnel Testing

## Problem Statement
Assume that the Dynamic Funnel Application you built is running and is underperforming. For the last few months you have been making one off tweaks to the page configuration, but experimentation has been limited as the app only supports one configuration and because tweaks, while easy to do, are blocked by a slower than designed release process. As you and the PM have talked this problem over, its become clear that investment in a way to give the PM (and others) control of the configuration files while also supporting many different options would solve these problems and unlock the experimentation you both think you need to optimize this part of the product.

With this context in mind, draft an implementation plan that sets out a longer term vision for the system while also creating a clear roadmap to get the first iteration out in the next sprint.


## The Vision

We want to build a system where PMs can manage configurations independently. This means they should be able to set up, test, and switch between different input pages without needing a new build or deployment. We also want to enable A/B testing to see what works best.

## Roadmap

### 1. Configuration Management Enhancement

**Objective:** Let’s make it so PMs can easily manage multiple configurations and switch between them without us having to rebuild the app.

**Tasks:**
1. **Dynamic Configuration Loading:**
   - Modify the app to load config files based on query parameters or a simple user interface. Something like this: `http://app-url?config=config1.json`.

2. **Configuration Management UI:**
   - Build a straightforward UI for uploading, editing, and managing configurations. Make sure we have validation to catch errors early.

3. **Dynamic Switching:**
   - Allow the app to switch configurations on the fly without needing a reload. This will keep things smooth and seamless for our users.



### 2. User Interface for Configuration Management

**Objective:** Provide an easy-to-use interface for managing and selecting configurations.

**Tasks:**
1. **Develop UI for Configuration Management:**
   - Create an intuitive UI where PMs can upload, edit, and select configurations. 
   - Ensure it’s user-friendly with features like validation and error handling.

2. **Documentation and Training:**
   - Write clear documentation on how to use the configuration management UI.
   - Hold training sessions to get PMs up to speed.


## 3. Iteration Plan

- **Phase 1:**
  - Implement configuration loading via query parameters.
  - Develop the configuration management UI.

- **Phase 2:**
  - Test the configuration management UI with PMs and stakeholders.
  - Document the UI usage and provide training sessions.

- **Phase 3:**
  - Refine and improve the UI based on feedback.
  - Address any additional features or bug fixes identified during testing.


## Conclusion

By focusing on simplicity and practicality, we can build a system that empowers our PMs and improves our funnel application without creating technical debt. This approach should balance high developer experience with high end-user experience. Let’s keep it simple, effective, and user-friendly.
